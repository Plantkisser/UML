This is a simple way to start use user-mode linux (UML) you can follow steps described in tutorial.txt, 
or use UMLFnl.sh to skip all steps.
Also you can use UML_strt.sh to run UML or use command in tutroial described in 20) step
And pay attention that UMLFnl.sh and init.st must be placed in the same directory it is necessary!!!!!!

And now some information about UML and how it works:
1) Info: this UMLs kernel and filesystem is based on CentOS 8.1.1911  
2) It wil be run with binnary file created with linux kernel sources
3) UML use directory which can be chosen by you in my scripts it is ~/UML/FS, 
   so if you need you can add some files to the UMLs filesystem from your host machine without running UML
